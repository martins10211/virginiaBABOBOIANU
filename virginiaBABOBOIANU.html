<h1 id="qtext"> (1) Question mostly ask what is a black card ? </h1>

<div> A black credit card is an ultra-exclusive card offered by some card issuers and typically reserved for their wealthiest customers. A black card is considered a status symbol in pop culture, in part by requiring card spending in the tens or hundreds of thousands to be considered for one, among other criteria</div>


<h1 id="qtext2"> (2) why is it blank card not having the long card nummber /pan or cvv on it ? </h1>
<div> why we do not put a long card nummber /pan or cvv on the card, is for security purpose because after the company release the card to the deliver agent to bring to you we do not trust second party with the card because of our past experience in the past, the card is blank front and black but very valid</div>
